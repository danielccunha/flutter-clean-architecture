# Flutter Clean Architecture

Flutter project developed during an awesome Clean Architecture course on [Youtube][playlist] published by [ResoCoder][channel]. I strongly recommend every Flutter developer to give it a chance, it's free and you'll learn a lot about tests, layered architecture, SOLID principles, among other essential concepts.
